A simple minigame made in the Bevy game engine. This is my first "game" in the engine and was just a way for me to learn the basics. 
To run it install the [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and running "cargo run" in the terminal
(First time you run it it might take up to 10 minutes or longer to run since its the first build)
